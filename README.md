# One-Mix-3-Hackintosh
This project attempts to bring MacOS to the One-Mix 3 &amp; 2s with Full Support

Current Status: 
		
    - macOS Sierra: 
			* Working: 
				1. Full Graphics in proper orientation
				2. Sound
				3. Battery status
				4. Bluetooth
				5. Track-point
				6. USB-C and USB-2
       
			* Partially Working:
				1. Shutdown and Restart (I believe this needs some minor tweaks to the clover config file)
					
      			* Not-Working:
				1. Built-in WiFi (will never work, unless future macOS supports)
				2. Fingerprint Sensor (Not sure if there is a fix or if it will ever be supported)
				3. Monitor Sleep, Suspend, Hibernate (common, monitor sleep should be fixable but suspend and hibernate likely will not)
				4. USB-3 at the standard port (USB-2 does work, additionally USB-3 plugged into a USB-2 hub will work in that port)
